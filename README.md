,,Sudoku Solver"


Aplication working useing frameworks like: Node.js Express.js MongoDB, Bcrypt. 
Rest file allows us to use request and post function so we can:
-created a user;
-hash our password;
-check matching of our data [username and password];

Authorization runs only in the console, in the future it will be wrapped in a page.

If authorization is succesfull the website pass us to main url where aplication being.
The aplication is call: ,, Sudoku solver". We can solve any board of numbers, the system check all boxes in board so if it find the issue, system will point it.

Main issues:
-in one box are two same numbers;
-in one vertical line are to same numbers;
-in one horizontal line are to same numbers;

To whole aplication is packed in well designed page created by using html,css, js technologies.

I hope you will have a great time using my site.
